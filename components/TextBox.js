        The Sir Syed Education Society of North America, a 501 (C) (3)
        non-profit organization, annually administers the Sir Syed Global
        Scholar Award (SSGSA). SSGSA is offered to students and alumni of the
        Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) from all faculties, including sciences,
        life sciences, medicine, arts, business, commerce, law, and education.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Sir Syed Global Scholar Award (SSGSA) was established in 2006 as Sir
        Syed Excellence Science Award to serve the needs of AMU Students
        interested in achieving higher education in the United States. It is
        designed to provide AMU students and alumni with financial assistance
        towards standardized tests and application fees, and personalized
        mentoring throughout the process from selection of universities to
        refining personal essays and resumes. Under the SSGSA program, so far
        over 120 AMU students have been successfully placed at various
        prestigious universities around the world including the United States.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the year 2012, we expanded the program to other disciplines to
        provide this opportunity to all AMU students irrespective of their area
        of study.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        SSGSA has a committed team of volunteers who mentor students and work
        with them for up to two years before students are successful in getting
        admission at prestigious Masters or Ph.D programs. These volunteers who
        mentor students are experts in their field. Upon arrival in US, the
        students in turn become mentors to other incoming students.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        SSGSA sincerely believes that such a practice creates an environment of
        grander participation and will result in a greater number of mentors to
        help AMU students.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The SSGSA team strives hard to enhance the brand image of AMU on two
        fronts
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mentoring meritorious students so they are successful in getting
        admission at prestigious graduate programs in US
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Expanding our strong formal network of academic mentors who also
        function as brand ambassadors of AMU at their respective organizations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With the help of these academic mentors when these bright students get
        admission and do well at such universities, they are encouraged to open
        their doors to more AMU students. Some of the institutes in India such
        as IITs have done this successfully and there is no reason we can&apos;t
        create the same brand image for AMU. To this end, the SSGSA team is also
        working to create a database of faculty members who are AMU alumni or
        well-wishers. In the past, several faculty members, researchers, and
        company executives have delivered seminars and presentations under the
        SSGSA banner to motivate AMU students regarding opportunities of higher
        education in US. These lectures have created significant awareness among
        AMU students.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        SSGSA also organizes webinars, workshops and many different events at
        AMU through which experts and SSGSA-mentors from US and other parts of
        the world interact with students to guide them on various topics related
        to higher education and research on a regular basis. In addition to
        increased exposure, these webinars are helpful in keeping students
        motivated throughout the application process that is long, tedious and
        expensive. Many students get distracted and move elsewhere due to lack
        of continuous motivation.SSGSA&apos;s goal is to identify meritorious
        students, empower them with knowledge and financial assistance, and help
        them to fulfill their ambition of higher education by keeping them
        focused with continued engagement.

        Sir Syed started &quot;the Aligarh Tehreek &quot; or education movement
        and we all can make a small contribution by our participation in SSGSA.
        Sir Syed said, &quot;Call me by whatever names you like. I will not ask
        you for my salvation. But please take pity of your children. Do
        something for them, lest you should have to repent&quot;. With these
        words in mind, we thank you for your support to SSGSA and hope for your
        continued engagement with this program.
