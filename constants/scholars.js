He is currently studying the dynamics of the boundary of the Heliosphere by observing Interstellar Neutral Particles like hydrogen, helium and oxygen detected by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). The heliosphere is a huge cavity around the solar system in the Local Interstellar Medium caused by the interaction of the solar wind to the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC). IBEX is a small NASA explorer mission launched in 2008 and is still active. He is also involved in the Interstellar Mapping Acceleration Probe (IMAP) which will be launched in 2025 by NASA, a successor of IBEX. IMAP will help to better understand the heliosphere and other astrospheres, as well as the position and future of the solar system in the galactic environment.',
