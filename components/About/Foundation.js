        The Sir Syed Global Scholar Award (SSGSA) is annually administered by the 
        Sir Syed Education Society of North America, a 501 (C) (3) non-profit organization. 
        The award is offered to students and alumni of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) 
        from all faculties. 

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This award was first given in 2006 as the Sir Syed Excellence in Science Award to 
        serve the needs of AMU Students interested in achieving higher education in the 
        United States. It was designed to provide AMU students and alumni with financial 
        assistance towards standardized tests and application fees, and personalized mentoring 
        throughout the process from selection of universities to refining personal essays and resumes. 
        Under the SSGSA program, so far over 120 AMU students have been successfully placed at 
        various prestigious universities around the world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
      SSGSA has a committed team of volunteers who mentor students 
      and work with them for up to two years before students successfully secure a 
      position in a Masterâ€™s or PhD program. These volunteers who mentor students are 
      experts in their field. After starting their degrees, the awardees often become 
      mentors to other incoming students. SSGSA sincerely believes that such a practice 
      creates an environment of grander participation and will result in a greater 
      number of mentors to help AMU students. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
      Several AMU faculty members, researchers, and company executives are also 
      part of the SSGSA network. In the past, many have delivered seminars, webinars, 
      workshops and presentations under the SSGSA banner to introduce AMU students to 
      opportunities of higher education abroad. In addition to increased exposure, these events are 
      helpful in keeping students motivated throughout the application process that is long, tedious and expensive. 
      Many students get distracted and move elsewhere due to lack of continuous motivation. 
      The SSGSA team aims to identify meritorious students, empower them with knowledge and financial assistance, 
      and help them to fulfill their ambition of higher education by keeping them focused with continued engagement.
