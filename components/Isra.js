          The International Summer Research Award (ISRA) is an excellent
          opportunity for young graduates, who wish to work for 2-3 months in the
          academic environment of prestigious universities of the United States
          of America (USA).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The program aims to give awardees a short exposure to the cutting-edge
          research environment and work culture of the US. Unlike the Sir Syed
          Global Scholar Award, (which is also administered by Sir Syed Education
          Society of North America) which helps you in applying for different
          universities in the US through significant financial assistance coupled
          with thorough mentoring, the ISRA provides a closer look, helping the
          aspirants from being familiarized with the research milieu of USA thereby
          boosting their application according to their training.
