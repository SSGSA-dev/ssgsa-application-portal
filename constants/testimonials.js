      'Realizing the role which SSGSA award played in moving towards \
      my career goals, I felt very enthusiastic to contribute to the \
      organization in order to help it expand and help more and more \
      students like me who aspire to receive quality education outside \
      India. In the past few years of my association with SSGSA as a member \
      of operational team, it has given me an opportunity of working with a \
      team, collaborating with people from both in and outside India and \
      most importantly communicating to students and planning their \
      applications. I believe that while working as a team member of SSGSA, \
      I have acquired important organizational skills, which are very \
      beneficial for my personal development and would also prove handy in \
      my professional career',

      "Throughout my journey to get an admit in one of the best \
      american universities and that too with an assistantship- about which \
      I had never thought, my trust in Opportunity as well as in Destiny \
      has been increasing to unimaginable levels. I just don't find enough \
      words to express my gratitude to Almighty God for whatever He has \
      bestowed upon me. And I also believe in all those hands(of God) here \
      on earth which have steered me throughout this strenuous journey. I \
      have no doubt when I say that SSGSA was one of those hands apart from \
      many others including the family I was born into.\n Opportunity is \
      what shapes our lives, something which dictates the path of our \
      destiny and SSGSA is doing a wonderful job of providing the \
      opportunity to young aspiring students when the dream of higher \
      studies in USA seems a distant dream at beginning.",

      "Being a SSGSA awardee and a proud member of the family, I feel \
      very much privileged. SSGSA not only encouraged me to dream big but \
      also helped me to pursue it. I am really amazed to observe the working \
      style of this family and the extent to which they cooperate with the \
      students.\n The struggles and achievements of the seniors from Aligarh \
      fraternity were great source of motivations for me. I am thankful to \
      SSGSA for providing me wonderful opportunities few years ago by \
      selecting me as one of its scholars, so that I could come to the US \
      for Ph.D. Perhaps, I could never afford this 'seemingly expensive' \
      dream. It was SSGSA, which changed my perceptions, dreams and \
      motivations of life.",

      with SSGSA team and observed that every student selection for SSGSA \
      awards is completely transparent and unbiased. I request everyone to \

      and application fee, but providing the invaluable motivation and \
      guidance which I believe is the most important component of studying \
      abroad. Mentors of SSGSA believed in me and made me realize that the \
      sky is indeed the limit. The hard work coupled with excellent \
      mentoring landed me into the Masterâ€™s program at Purdue University, a \
      highly-reputed US University.',
